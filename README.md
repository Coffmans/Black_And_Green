In my searches for a theme for MS Edge\Chrome, I wanted one that was somewhat specific.
* Black background
* Green text for active tab
* White text for invactive tab
* A lighter shade of black for the omnibox
* Green text for the bookmarks

Though Chrome had a lot of themes that fit this description, most were not compatible with MS Edge. Thus, I decided to make my own theme.

_To make it even better, I added the following parameter to the MS Edge shortcut to show the yellow folder icons next to the bookmarks._

_-disable-features=msFavoritesMonolineFolder_
